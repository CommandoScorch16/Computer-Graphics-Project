#My re-creation of Tombstone, Arizona in OpenGl
##
##For this project, I recreated the town layout of Tombstone Arizona from an old map I found, located [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Tombstone_fire_insurance_map_1888.jpg)
##The code for this project is implemented in C. External functions and files are implemented by Professor Willem Schrueder.

#Historical Buildings implemented so far:
##1. The Occidental Hotel
###The Occidental Hotel had a short but interesting life. It was founded in 1883, and it burned down in 1889. It supposedly could accomidate over a hundred guests. 


##2. The Birdcage Theatre
###The Birdcage is one of the few remaining original buildings in Tombstone. It withstood the big fire in 1882, and to this day has around 140 various bullet holes in the walls and ceiling. In fact, in 1882, The New York Times refered to it as "...the wildest, wickedest night spot between Basin Street and the Barbary Coast."
