#My re-creation of Tombstone, Arizona in OpenGl
##
##For this project, I recreated the town layout of Tombstone Arizona from an old map I found, located [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Tombstone_fire_insurance_map_1888.jpg)

#Historical Buildings implemented so far:
##1. The Occidental Hotel


##2. The Birdcage Theatre
###The Birdcage is one of the few remaining original buildings in Tombstone. It withstood the big fire in 1882, and to this day has around 140 various bullet holes in the walls and ceiling. In fact, in 1882, The New York Times refered to it as "...the wildest, wickedest night spot between Basin Street and the Barbary Coast."
